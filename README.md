### Reproduce

- Start the Extension project which will host a StringVisualizer in the Experimental Hive.
- In the Experimental Hive, open the demo solution.
- As shown in the video ScreenCast, inside the F# function ModuleF.f(), the visualizer does not open, debugging this problem is not possible.
